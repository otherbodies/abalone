1. Prepare separate pre-processed data-files for each participant and task
//all correct files are now in allfiles3 folder
// can use excel macro, but change name to outlier not outliers 

2. Update metatable file

3. Create whole data sheet //  run selected lines from the function in loadfrommetatable.R 
bind the processed files into one dataframe and save as a file

4. Process outliers //TODO - function, and file where it lies

5. Analysis //TODO



5.1 Model shift computation, and write to file
5.2 COmparisons with model shift
September for Co1months - head is missing - removing it from analysis in other files


Notes: Some code is repeated - useful bits copied to loadfrommetatable.R file. 


6. Graphs code will be in abalone-plotting.R file

7. some new ideas and experimentation in file furtherdataprocessing.R


8. Pooled sd - good references here:
